        <strong>What to do to protect and take care of animals after the hurricane:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Download the VetsPlusMore, Paw Boost, and Finding Rover apps which can help find temporary foster homes.</li>
			<li>The Sato Project which works in the area of Yabucoa works on helping dogs in extreme poverty. (saved over 1,600 dogs since 2011, and can save a lot more with more donations).</li>
			<li>Do not attempt to reduce a dogâ€™s pain by giving it pain killers of any type. The alternative is to exercise the dog as much as possible.</li>
			<li>Bring the dog to a local shelter as soon as possible so that the dog has access to food, water, and shelter.</li>
