        <strong>FEMA recommends all residents and visitors in the path of a hurricane should review these tips:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure your <a href="https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit">emergency kit</a> is ready, and test your <a href="https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan">family communications plan</a>.</li>
            <li>Plan to stay in a shelter, and not in a home damaged by the previous storm. Let friends, family or coworkers know where you are taking shelter.</li>
            <li>Stay vigilant and continue to monitor local radio or TV stations for local emergency management officials’ guidance, and for updated weather and emergency information.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app">FEMA App</a> (available in English and Spanish) provides National Weather Service alerts and directions to open shelters. Check this app every half hour to save your cell phone battery.</li>
            <li>Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every half hour to keep up with the latest weather updates.</li>
            <li>Only use social media to check in with family, friends and/or co-workers. Do not use social media to record/photograph the storm to conserve your phone’s battery.</li>
            <li>Close storm shutters, and stay away from the windows, as flying glass from the windows could injure you.</li>
            <li>Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and only open when necessary. If you lose power, this will ensure the food lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Remember, never run a generator inside and keep it away from windows, doors, and vents.</li>
            <li>If using candles, please use caution. If possible, use flashlights instead. If you must use candles, do not burn them on or near anything that can catch fire.</li>
            <li>Businesses of all sizes are encouraged to follow directions of local officials and to share safety messaging with employees in order to reduce risk.</li>
            <li>Remember, your life and family safety is key. Do not risk your life to attempt to save household possessions.</li>
          </ul>
